# Strict Null Check

A Gradle plugin to make your Java ☕ code check for **nullability** by default

## How it works

The `strict-null-check` plugin leverages _possible_ implementations of JSR-305 to add package-level annotations to your project that can add a non-null behavior to all variables, parameters, fields, etc. So in simple words, the plugin will automatically create all the `package-info.java` files for you with the configured annotation(s). And that's it! You can have strict null checks in java without ever worrying about creating all the `package-info.java` files for all your project packages.

Although, it's important to take into account that:
* The `package-info.java` files are generated right after the `classes` task, so you might need to compile (or run `./gradlew classes`) whenever you create a new package
* By default, the `package-info.java` files are created on the project's `build/` folder, under a `generated/` directory. However, this can be configured by the plugin's extension
* The plugin adds FindBug's JSR-305 as a `compileOnly` dependency. The version can be configured through the plugin's extension

## Requirements

* The [Java Plugin](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_plugin.html) is required to:
  - Find the `classes` task
  - Find the `compileOnly` configuration

```gradle
plugins {
  id 'java'
}
```

## Usage

> **⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES ⚠️**
>
> Due to changes on GitHub, and by consequence Gradle and Maven, it's no longer allowed to use `com.github` as a valid group ID prefix. That being said, from version v2.0.0 of the plugin the ID is now `io.github.joselion.strict-null-check`. If you want to use a version prior to v2.0.0 you can still find it under `com.github.joselion.strict-null-check`, but keep in mind that the `io.github` prefixed ID does not have any v1.x.x version available.

You can get the latest version from Gradle's plugins site:
https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/io.github.joselion.strict-null-check

Using the [plugins DSL](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/plugins.html#sec:plugins_block):
```gradle
plugins {
  id 'io.github.joselion.strict-null-check' version 'x.x.x'
}
```

Using [legacy plugin application](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/plugins.html#sec:old_plugin_application):
```gradle
buildscript {
  repositories {
    maven {
      url 'https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/'
    }
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath 'io.github.joselion:plugin:x.x.x'
  }
}

apply plugin: 'io.github.joselion.strict-null-check'
```

With the plugin applied, run `./gradlew classes` and the `package-info.java` file tree will be generated for you. And that's it! But remember, whenever a new package is created you'll need to run the `classes` task again.

**Note**: Running `./gradlew build` will also do the trick since the `build` task depends on the `compileJava` task, which depends on the `classes` task.

### Extension

The default extension configuration looks like this:
```gradle
strictNullCheck {
  annotations = ['org.eclipse.jdt.annotation.NonNullByDefault']
  generatedDir = "$buildDir/generated"
  versions {
    eclipseAnnotations = '2.2.600'
    findBugs = '3.0.2'
  }
}
```

### Extension properties

| Property                    | Default                                           | Description |
| --------------------------- | :-----------------------------------------------: | ----------- |
| annotation                  | `['org.eclipse.jdt.annotation.NonNullByDefault']` | List of fully qualified class names of the annotations to add to all the generated `package-info.java` files |
| generatedDir                | `"$buildDir/generated"`                           | The directory where the `package-info.java` files should be generated |
| packageJavadoc              | -                                                 | A single or multi-line string to add to the Javadoc of the generated `package-info.java` files |
| versions                    | -                                                 | A closure to configure the versions of the dependencies added |
| versions.findBugs           | `'3.0.2'`                                         | The `FindBugs JSR305` version to use. Check the [MVNRepo][1] for more versions |
| versions.eclipseAnnotations | `'2.2.600'`                                       | The `JDT Annotations` version to use. Check the [MVNRepo][2] for more versions |
| useSpring                   | -                                                 | A shortcut function to use Spring's null-safety annotation |

### The `useSpring()` shortcut

This function can be called inside the `strictNullCheck` closure as a shortcut to set Spring's null-safety annotations in the extension configuration. That is, setting:
```gradle
strictNullCheck {
  useSpring()
}
```

Is equivalent to:
```gradle
strictNullCheck {
  annotations = [
    'org.springframework.lang.NonNullApi',
    'org.springframework.lang.NonNullFields'
  ]
}
```

### Overriding package-info.java

Having more than one `package-info.java` file on the same package classpath may cause issues during compilation. To avoid this kind of issues, the plugin will not generate a `package-info.java` file if it already exists. This is also convenient if you'd like to override the annotations on a specific package.

The only pitfall of this behavior is that you might need to clean the `build/` folder if a `package-info.java` file was generated on a previous run. Also, if you just want to add more annotations to the package aside from the nullability annotations the plugin adds, you'll have to add the extra annotations, plus the nullability annotation. For example:
```sh
./gradlew clean
```

Now we overide a `package-info.java` file.
```java
// We add an extra annotation
@Deprecated
// But we want to keep the nullability annotations for this package
@NonNullApi
@NonNullFields
package com.acme.app;

import java.lang.Deprecated;

import org.springframework.lang.NonNullApi;
import org.springframework.lang.NonNullFields;
```


### Tasks

The plugin adds a task named `generatePackageInfo`. So if you want, you could also run `./gradlew generatePackageInfo` instead of running the `classes` task.
