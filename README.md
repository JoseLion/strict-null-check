# Strict Null Check Plugin
A Gradle plugin to add full **Strict Null Check** to your Java code â˜•

## How it works
The `strict-null-check` plugin leverages _possible_ implementations of JSR-305 to add package-level annotations to your project that can add a non-null behavior to all variables, parameters, fields, etc. So in simple words, the plugin will automatically create all the `package-info.java` files for you with the configured annotation(s). And that's it! You can have strict null checks in java without ever worrying about creating all the `package-info.java` files for all your project packages.

Although, it's important to take into account that:
* The `package-info.java` files are generated right after the `classes` task, so you might need to compile (or run `./gradlew classes`) whenever you create a new package
* By default, the `package-info.java` files are created on the project's `build/` folder, under a `generated/` directory. However, this can be configured by the plugin's extension
* The plugin adds Findbug's JSR-305 as a `compileOnly` dependency. The version can be configured through the plugin's extension

## Requirements
* The [Java Plugin](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_plugin.html) is required to:
  - Find the `classes` task
  - Find the `compileOnly` configuration

```gradle
plugins {
  id 'java'
}
```

## Usage
You can get the latest version from Gradle's plugins site:
https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.github.joselion.strict-null-check

Using the [plugins DSL](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/plugins.html#sec:plugins_block):
```gradle
plugins {
  id 'com.github.joselion.strict-null-check' version 'x.x.x'
}
```

Using [legacy plugin application](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/plugins.html#sec:old_plugin_application):
```gradle
buildscript {
  repositories {
    maven {
      url 'https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/'
    }
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath 'gradle.plugin.com.github.joselion:plugin:x.x.x'
  }
}

apply plugin: 'com.github.joselion.strict-null-check'
```

## Extension
The default extension configuration looks like this:
```gradle
strictNullCheck {
  annotations = []
  findbugsVersion = '3.0.2'
  generatedDir = "$buildDir/generated"
}
```

### Extension properties
| Property        | Default                 | Description |
| --------------- | :---------------------: | ----------- |
| annotation      | `[]`                    | List of fully qualified class names of the annotations to add to all generated `package-info.java` files |
| findbugsVersion | `'3.0.2'`               | The Findbugs version to use. Check [MVNRepo][1] for more version |
| generatedDir    | `"$buildDir/generated"` | The directory where the `package-info.java` files should be generated |
| useSpring       | `-`                     | A shortcut function to use Spring's null-safety annotation |

### The `useSpring()` shortcut
This function can be called inside the `strictNullCheck` closure as a shortcut to set Spring's null-safety annotations in the extension configuration. That is, setting:
```gradle
strictNullCheck {
  useSpring()
}
```

Is equivalent to:
```gradle
strictNullCheck {
  annotations = [
    'org.springframework.lang.NonNullApi',
    'org.springframework.lang.NonNullFields'
  ]
}
```
